# Introductory HTML and JavaScript
## How websites are created ?
Small websites are written using *HTML* & *CSS*.
By the time HTML & CSS are improved and now there are many versions of them, the latest versions are **HTML5** & **CSS3**.

Some sites are very complex so may use a database to store data, and programming languages such as PHP, ASP, Net, Java.

### How the web works ?
 First we should know some concepts.
 * People access websites using
software called a **web browser** like *Chrome* and *Firefox*.

* When we ask our browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special
computer known as a **web server** which hosts the website.

* To find the location of the web server, our browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server, that tell our browser how to find the website. 

So we enter the web address that we want to access it on our browser , the computer contacts the network of srevers (DSN) that returns the IP address associated with the web that we want to access it . This IP allows our browser to contact the web server that hosts the website we requested.The web server then sends the page we requested back to our web browser.
